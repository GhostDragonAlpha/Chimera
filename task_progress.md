# Session 2026-07-06 — Loop 8 System_SaveLoad VERIFIED & MERGED (master be7e960)

**Pipeline run: UBT `Result: Succeeded, 83.03s`, exit code 0, ALL GATES PASSED. Professor grade B.
46 generated files integrity-checked. Merged `loop8-saveload` → master (7203b62); branch deleted.**

Delivered via the generator (workflow-correct, survives regeneration — proven: the pipeline
regenerated Save/Economy/Factions from the fixed templates and built green):
- `generate_save_game_class_file()` — SaveGame stores: credits, cargo map, ship state, player location+rotation, full `FMissionData` arrays (objective progress survives), completed/failed mission names, faction standings + relationships, station supplies, timestamp.
- `generate_save_game_component_files()` — `SaveGame`/`LoadGame` read/restore `InventoryTradeComponent`, `MissionComponent` (4 arrays), `FactionComponent` (both maps), owner transform, with logging. Was a timestamp-only stub.
- `InventoryTradeComponent` (manual file; generator does not emit it): added `GetCargo()`/`SetCargo()`.

Ledger: System_Economy / System_Factions / System_SaveLoad = implemented. GPA 2.9 flat.
Playtests: 3 skipped (headless env — need running editor + `Automation RunTests ChimeraTests`).

## NEXT
1. System_Missions: record implemented (code healthy + compiled in the green run) → `loop_complete` Loop 8.
2. Ledger repair: loops 3–7 show not_started (quarantine artifact) — re-record from VisualVerification evidence with `--backfilled`.
3. Loop 9 (The Universe) per Spiral order — or revisit Loop 0 open items (Player_Character_Model needs_refinement, Animation blocked).
4. In-editor playtest pass when UE is open: `Automation RunTests ChimeraTests`.

# Session 2026-07-05/06 — Full Pipeline Solidification

## Final State
- **Graph**: ~1015 nodes, 0 junk, 0 without provenance
- **GPA**: 1.4 (trend flat) — build trend last 20: 20 pass, 0 fail
- **Scene Verification**: 4 mandatory layers deployed, all non-skippable
- **Pipeline**: All gates mandatory, exit code 1 on any violation

## What Changed

### New files
- `core/gates.py` — 12 mandatory hard gates, all block pipeline on failure
- `core/scene_verifier.py` — 4-layer scene verification via MCP (engine facts + screenshot + LM text + LM vision)
- `core/mcp_client.py` — MCP tool call helper for chiR24-unreal bridge

### Modified files
- `core/game_generation_orchestrator.py` — Stage 7 replaced with 4-layer scene verifier, all stage transitions hardened with gates
- `core/build_orchestrator.py` — UE auto-kill before build, auto-restart after, generated-file integrity check, build-retry loop, locked-file graceful handling
- `core/preflight.py` — Build trend analysis, exit code 1 on critical violations
- `core/postflight.py` — Automated git status check
- `core/visual_verifier.py` — UE foreground wait loop, LM Studio URL fix, encoding sanitization
- `core/gates.py` — GPA gate deduplicates, cumulative GPA vs raw grades
- `core/playtest_runner.py` — SKIPPED status instead of false FAILED, pass_rate excludes skips
- `core/game_code_generator.py` — MissionComponent emits real AcceptMission/UpdateObjective
- `core/ubt_builder.py` — capture_output=True (was missing)
- `run_deep_space_trader_pipeline.py` — Exit code propagation, GateViolation handling
- `.gitignore` — stale dirs excluded
- `CLAUDE.md` — full rewrite with gates, scene verifier, MCP, conventions

### Verified working
- Build: 5/5 cycles pass (9 actions, ~13s each)
- Pre-Flight: GPA, build trend, loop board, zero junk
- Scene verifier Layer 1: hard facts pass (deterministic)
- Scene verifier Layer 3: qwen3.6 text reasoning pass
- Scene verifier Layer 4: qwen3.6 vision correctly identifies empty level
- MCP screenshot: captures UE viewport render, not desktop

### Gates verified
- `gate_no_stale_trees`: caught ProceduralGenerated/ artifact, blocked pipeline
- `gate_gpa_not_critically_falling`: correctly uses cumulative GPA
- `gate_build_succeeded`: blocks on UBT failure
- `stage_7_visual`: blocks on any scene verifier layer failure
- Pre-Flight exit code 1 on violations

### Known blockers for next session
- Scene verifier Layer 4 blocks because level has no game actors spawned
- 3 playtests skip (no headless UE automation in desktop env)
- System_Economy pending LM Studio re-review for A grade

## How to resume
1. Launch UE Editor → `start "" "path\to\UnrealEditor.exe" "E:\PythonChimera\Chimera\Chimera.uproject"`
2. `python -m core.preflight` to check state
3. `python run_deep_space_trader_pipeline.py` — all gates fire, scene verifier runs
4. `python -m core.postflight --phase "..." --result "..."` to record
