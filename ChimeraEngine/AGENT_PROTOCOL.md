# AGENT_PROTOCOL.md — the session contract for implementation agents

You are an implementation agent on SPIACE. Kimi K3 (or the operator) verifies your
work and commits it. **You never run git commit/push.** Every rule below was earned
by a real failure — the incident is cited so you know why it exists.

## THE FIVE RULES

**1. Green baseline BEFORE you edit; green suite BEFORE you report.**
Build and run the existing suite before writing a line (that baseline tells you the
tree was sane when you arrived), and run it again after your last edit. A refactor
that ships untested ships broken — the relay genome-switch refactor deadlocked the
whole viewer on its first request (`Lock` re-acquired → `RLock` fix) because the
session ended before one suite run.

**2. "Done" is a log file, not a claim.**
Your final report includes: the command you ran, PASS/FAIL counts, the measured
numbers, and the path to the saved output (e.g. `engine/scratch/_myrun.log`).
"All green" without a log path is treated as "unverified."

**3. Docs go LAST, append-only, and you `wc -l` after every edit.**
An agent session died mid-write on `engine/SPIACE_RPG_PLAN.md` and left it 0 lines —
recovery needed the git history. PLAN.md edits: append your section, bump the footer,
then verify line count grew. The pre-commit doc-guard refuses any PLAN.md shrink
> 50 lines unless you set `CHIMERA_ALLOW_PLAN_SHRINK=1` and say why.

**4. Running out of context? Write the handoff, then stop.**
Before you die: append to `engine/scratch/HANDOFF.md` — what's done (files touched),
what's unverified, the exact next command. Never leave uncommitted, untested work
with no note. The N8 relay refactor was found deadlocked with zero explanation.

**5. Scratch goes in `engine/scratch/` (gitignored).**
Probe scripts, logs, dumps — all of it. `git status` should show only files you
mean to ship. If you create scratch elsewhere, delete it before session end.

## KEY PATHS (go here first; do not explore blindly)

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Native core (C++ CA/physics/rig/nav) | `ChimeraEngine/native/ca_core.cpp` |
| Genomes (data, key=value) | `ChimeraEngine/native/genomes/*.chimera` |
| Native↔viewer relay (SSE, port 8799) | `ChimeraEngine/native/relay.py` |
| Native viewer (zero sim logic) | `ChimeraEngine/engine/spiace_native.html` |
| Native test harness (headed Playwright) | `ChimeraEngine/engine/test_native.py` |
| Browser engine (WebGPU splat + BH kernels) | `ChimeraEngine/engine/spiace_phase6.html` |
| Kernel DSL (do not modify unless told) | `ChimeraEngine/engine/kernel_dsl.py` |
| Browser test harness | `ChimeraEngine/engine/test_phase6.py` |
| The plan / ledger (append-only) | `ChimeraEngine/engine/SPIACE_RPG_PLAN.md` |
| TRELLIS image→3D runtime + weights | `models/trellis/` (needs `out/` dir to exist for `--voxply`) |

Standard verify commands:
```bash
cd ChimeraEngine/native && g++ -O2 -std=c++17 -Wall -o ca_core.exe ca_core.cpp   # zero warnings
cd ChimeraEngine/engine && python test_native.py                                # native suite (headed)
cd ChimeraEngine/engine && python kernel_dsl.py --verify spiace_phase6.html     # DSL gate
```

## HOW YOU'LL BE TASKED (the staged pattern)

Tasks over ~300 lines of diff arrive as STAGES, each < 150k tokens of context:
**Stage 1 verify-only → Stage 2 wire+prove → Stage 3 extend+docs.** Each stage ends
in a commit by Kimi, so a dead session costs at most one stage. Your prompt names
exact files and line numbers — use them; exploration is for when they're wrong.

Rule 0 always: statement, prediction, falsifier named BEFORE the run. An honest
stall pinned with measured Q-values beats a patched pass — see the N8 CASE B entry
in PLAN.md for the model of how to document one.
